Customer: Firefly Design LLC
Board: Firefly Ice Blue 1.3.1
Number of Layers: 4
Dimensions: 34mm x 34mm
PCB Thickness: 0.031"
Micro Vias L1-L2
Tented Vias
ENIG
RoHS Compliant
Lead Free Processing

Plated Micro Vias In Pad:
There are micro-vias in pads.  They should be filled flat and plated over.

Plated Slots:
There are 2 slots for mounting the USB connector (J1).  These slots should
be plated through.  The finished slot size is 0.6 mm x 1.1 mm with a radius
of 0.3 mm.  Please see page 3 of the ZX62WD1-B-5PC specification:

Changes to 1.3.1 from revision 1.3.0:
1) Added top and bottom documentation layers to top and bottom silk.

Changes to 1.3.0 from revision 1.2.0:
1) Fixed issue with inner layers connecting with plating for mounting holes of
USB connector J1.
2) Fixed MOSI/MISO reversal to memory chip.
3) Added CS pullup for memory chip to its power rail.

Changes to 1.2.0 from revision 1.1.0:
1) USB connector J1 has changed.  The new connector requires plated through
oval mounting holes.  (See above.)
2) Capactior & Resistor footprints have changed to conform to Vishay documents.
3) 0402 LED footprints have changed.
4) Some component locations and orientations have changed.
5) Added two new fiducials on opposite side of each board (top right, and
bottom left).
6) Removed stop mask for vias so they will be tented.
7) Added milling layer *.mill for connector slots and panel cutouts.
8) All layers have changed.

Notes:
1) The design is done with Eagle 6 (files are of type sch, brd, and lib)..
2) The tDocu shows all reference designators and orientation for assembly of the top side.
3) The bDocu shows all reference designators and orientation for assembly of the bottom side.
4) DRC rules and CAM setup are from Sunstone Circuits.  For CAM setup use tsilk for top side silk and bsilk for bottom side silk.
5) Centroid file generator is from Screaming Circuits.
