Notes:
1) The design is done with Eagle 7.7.0 (files are of type sch, brd, and lib)..
2) Use Firefly Design BOM tool to generate the BOM from the schematic.
3) The tDocu & Document layers show all reference designators and orientation for assembly of the top side.
4) The bDocu shows all reference designators and orientation for assembly of the bottom side.
5) DRC rules and CAM setup are from Sunstone Circuits.  For CAM setup use _tsilk for top side silk and _bsilk for bottom side silk.
6) Centroid file generator is from Screaming Circuits.
